# Experiments Privacy Policy

As is publicly verifiable via the source code available at the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/splatterxl/experiments), the Experiments
Discord Application does not collect personal data of any of its users.

The only data we knowingly collect and manage is temporary guild cache to supply
our services. Collecting guild informating and caching them is necessary to
avoid excessive HTTP requests to Discord's API. This information is never stored
permanently and is completely purged when the Application is removed from a
server. By using the Application, you agree to the collection of aforementioned
data.

Simple logging is implemented to supply statistics and usage data to the
maintainers of the Application, which is not stored permanently and only
displayed in console logs. These logs are only available to the maintainers of
the Application. This usage data consists purely of command usage and
addition/removal of guilds, and by executing any of those actions you agree to
stated logging.
