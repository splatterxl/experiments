# Experiments Privacy Policy

The bot collects certain data during its processing of slash commands.

This includes your user information (unique ID provided by Discord and your
username), to display logs. This is only accessed for debugging purposes.

If you run `/check`, you have an option to provide a server ID to check on. If
you decide to do so, we will collect certain data about this server, if
possible, to allow the `/check` command to run with the best accuracy. This
includes your server's ID, feature flags[^1], vanity URL code, member count and
hub type (if applicable).

The bot does not collect your personal data or message content. All data is
purged very soon after it is accessed. Because of that, your rights under the
GDPR do not apply as we do not store any personal data (or any data at all) long
enough to be able to access, erase, rectify, etc. it.

[^1]:
    Feature flags are sent by Discord for every server, to enable certain
    experiments and features within the Discord app. They are specific strings
    of text that are automatically or manually applied to your server by
    Discord, e.g. `GUILD_ROLE_SUBSCRIPTIONS`, `WIDGET_ENABLED`.
